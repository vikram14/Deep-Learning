# Deep Learning and Neural Networks
Regular feed forward neural networks were the basis/foundation of all the other types of neural networks that were developed. Although, it  it is not as efficient at learning a large number of tasks due to the lack of parameter sharing and an extremely large number of paramters as the layers get deeper, it is still very powerful and provides a great intuition about how the more complex networks work mathematically and structurally. This set of programs develop a basic feed forward deep neural network and use it for less complex class like planar data classification.
