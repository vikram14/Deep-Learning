# Deep-Learning
This is a collection of programs coded as a part of the DeepLearning.ai specialization course
Deep Learning is a subset of a much larger set of learning methods(Supervised and Unsupervised) based on artificial networks. It is the key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning has been getting lots of attention lately and deservedly so, as itâ€™s achieving results that were not possible less than a decade ago. 

In this repository we deal with only supervised learning algorithms for networks ranging from regular feedforward neural networks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks(RNNs).
