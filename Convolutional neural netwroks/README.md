# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
A CNN is a type of a  deep learning network primarily used for image data. It was inspired by how individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.

CNNs have different architectures, example: AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet and U-net. Studying all of these architectures gives you an intuition about when and what kind of architectures and hyperparameters are used for certain tasks.
