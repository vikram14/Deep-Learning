# Sequence models, RNNs and Natural Language Processing
RNNs are a class of neural networks used for learning tasks that involve temporary data such as speech recognition, machine transaltion, sentiment analysis, language models, etc. An important feature that distinguishes RNNs from regular feedforward neural networks is parameter sharing, which is  an effective way of leveraging the relationship between one input item and its surrounding neighbors in a more intrinsic fashion compared to a vanilla neural network. Modifications such as LSTMs and GRU help propagte certain features through the network withot it being altered much thus allowing for more efiicient inferences from an input item's neighbours.
